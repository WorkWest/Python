# Ranges

```python
list.range(5) # A sequence of numbers. Starts at a default of 0.
list.range(5-10)  # A sequence of numbers. Starts at 5 ends at 9.
list.range(3, 10, 2) # A sequence of numbers. Starts at 3 and ends at 9 but only displays every 2nd number. 

# For loop using a range
for number in range(5):  # Range(5) is equal to [0,1,2,3,4]
    print(number)
```
