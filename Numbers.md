```python
print(50 + 50) #Addition
print(50 - 50) #Subtraction
print(50 * 50) #Multiplication
print(50 / 50) #Division with remainder (or a float)
print(50 ** 2) #Exponents 
print(50 % 6) #Modulo - Takes what is left over
print(50 // 6) #Division with no remainder

# ----------Math----------
addition = "+"
subtraction = "-"
multiplication = "*"
division = "/"  # Always returns a float
floor_division = "//"  # The fractional part of the number is disregarded (anything after the .)
modulo = "%"  # Returns the remainder that is left over from division
exponents = "**"

hex = 0xa

round(8.4) #Round number
bin(8) #Binary value

# You can convert different type of numbers by using int
